/*
    Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns
    a list of its branch sums ordered from leftmost branch
    sum to rightmost branch sum. A branch sum is the sum of
    all values in a Binary Tree branch (a paath of nodes in
    a tree that starts at the root and ends at any left node).

    Each Binary Tree node has an integar value, a left child
    nmode, and a right child node. Children nodes can either
    be Binary Tree nodes themselves or null (if a leaf).

  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
